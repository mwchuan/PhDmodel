# **PhDmodel**

SPICE models used in my PhD thesis





**Notes**

* The codes will also be available in my PhD thesis (Appendix section) as soon as the thesis is available at the library of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.

* The self-consistent potential was extracted from TOB nanotransistor model and fitted using MATLAB curve fitting tool for fifth order polynomial.

* Run using Synopsis HSPICE (Please keep all the SPICE file in the same folder)

* These codes are published mainly for thesis evaluation.

* AlSi<sub>3</sub> - Uniformly doped silicene with Aluminium (p-type)
