# **PhDmodel**

-SPICE models used in my PhD thesis

-The model belongs to project: https://www.researchgate.net/project/Doped-Silicene-MOSFET?_sg=skYAufJ7Tckvhax-3_ii3JmUGTWNk9FOay6dtvrg1FOgevTa4q_3NIM0vY2wulPOFYTmSRMsAm7Zxl_4ygTIlaoV_ph_sqgiHs9a



**Notes**

* The codes will also be available in my PhD thesis (Appendix section) as soon as the thesis is available at the library of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.

* The self-consistent potential was extracted from TOB nanotransistor model and fitted using MATLAB curve fitting tool for fifth order polynomial.

* Run using Synopsis HSPICE

* These codes are published mainly for thesis evaluation.



===================================================================
**The CMOS inverter composes of MOSFETs with channel material of:**

* **AlSi_3** - Uniformly doped silicene with Aluminium (p-type)
* **PSi_3** - Uniformly doped silicene with Phosphorus (n-type)
