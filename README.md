# **PhDmodel**

-SPICE models used in my PhD thesis

-The self-consistent potential was extracted from TOB nanotransistor model and fitted using MATLAB curve fitting tool for fifth order polynomial 

-Run using Synopsis HSPICE

**The CMOS inverter composes of MOSFETs with channel material of:**

* **AlSi_3** - Uniformly doped silicene with Aluminium (p-type)
* **PSi_3** - Uniformly doped silicene with Phosphorus (n-type)


**Notes**
-These codes are published for thesis evaluation.

-The codes will also be available in my PhD thesis (Appendix section) as soon as the thesis is available at the library of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.
